# Kin Improvement Proposal
The purpose of this document is to outline a proposed improvement to the existing KRE algorithm. 

*versioning:*
- *2.1*

## Proposed by:
*Kik Interactive Inc*

## Abstract
This is a simple fix to remove the language "buy demand" and replace with simply "demand".
While the Buy Track definitely does incentivize developers to create buy demand for users, the variable "buy_demand_i" is not actually an accurate description of buy demand. In order to alleviate confusion, we recommend replacing this language with "demand".

## Summary of Improvements
- Replace all references to "buy_demand_i" with "demand_i" and all references to "KRE_prior_buy_demand_payouts_i" with "KRE_prior_buy_payouts_i".

## Implementation
We propose that this change happens immediately pending approval from the Kin Foundation.
