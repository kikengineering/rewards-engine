# Kin Improvement Proposal
The purpose of this document is to outline a proposed improvement to the Valid Transaction Guidelines. 

*versioning:*
- *Valid Transaction Guidelines 2.1*

## Proposed by:
*Kik Interactive Inc. with significant contributions and revisions by asparagusm.*

## Abstract
The purpose of this proposal is to introduce more effective policy for policing KRE payouts. This proposal does not attempt to change the KRE algorithm: an app who is following the Valid Transaction Guidelines should see no change to their KRE payouts. 

The proposal tightens existing process for KRE violations and introduces the Kin Community Council as a violations filter for the Kin Foundation.

## Summary of Improvements

### Valid Transaction Guidelines 2.1 ###

*The text below is to replace SECTION C of the Valid Transaction Guidelines.*

**SECTION C - PROCESS FOR HANDLING VIOLATIONS**

10. **Reporting a breach**

A breach of these KRE Transaction Guidelines can be reported by creating a new issue on Github: https://github.com/kinecosystem/rewards-engine/issues (a "Report"). The title of the report must contain "KRE Violation" as well as the name of the Application. In the report, please reference the specific rule(s) breached along with reasonable evidence.

11. **Decision making process**

11.1. If we reasonably believe that your Application is in breach of these KRE Transaction Guidelines or that there is a case to answer in the Report:

(a) we will provide notice to you; and

(b) we will withhold any payments your Application is due to receive from the KRE while we investigate and until a final decision is made.

11.2 Within 14 days from the date the Report is posted, the Kin Community Council will review the Report and the Application and determine whether the alleged breach of the KRE Transaction Guidelines is substantiated:

(a) if the breach is substantiated: the matter will be referred to the Kin Foundation for the final decision;

(b) if the breach is not substantiated: the Report will be closed. Any payments that were withheld from the Application during this period will be released in full.

11.3 No delay in making a decision, or any Application remedying the breach in the intervening period will act as a waiver or impede the decision making process.

12. **Developer is in violation**

12.1. If we determine that your Application breached the KRE Transaction Guidelines:

(a) we will provide notice to you;

(b) we may suspended your Application from receiving all payments from the KRE (if we are already withholding your payments, you will be deemed to be suspended from the date we began withholding these payments);

(c) we may additionally provide steps you need to take to remedy the breach however we are not obliged to give you the option to remedy the breach

12.2 any payments that would have been paid to you during the period of the suspension will instead be added to the KRE Carryover pool for use in the remainder of the current calendar year.

12.3 Repeated or a serious breach of these KRE Transaction Guidelines may result in your permanent ban from the KRE.

12.4 Any suspension may be instated, lifted or reinstated at our sole discretion and subject to any conditions we see fit.

13 **Remedying a breach**
If you have breached these KRE Transaction Guidelines:

13.1 we may permit you to remedy the breach where it is capable of remedy by providing an updated version of the Application in each app store it is available evidencing that the Application is no longer in breach of these KRE Transaction Guidelines;

13.2 any payouts from the KRE that the Application would have received during the period the Application was suspended from payouts will not be re-credited.

## Implementation
We propose that this change happens immediately pending approval from the Kin Foundation.
