## Kin Improvement Proposal - KRE V2.2.4
The purpose of this document is to outline a proposed new version of the KRE Algorithm

## Proposed by: Kik Interactive Inc. 

## Abstract
The KRE Buy Track rewards developers for getting users to buy Kin using their fiat dollars or attention through ads. In order to participate in the KRE Buy Track, developers must use approved Modules. Approved Buy Modules may currently pay developers/users up to 3x the market rate for Kin. We recommend that this cap be lowered so that Buy Module developers can pay users/developers at most the market rate for Kin. This will ensure that the KRE is paying at most 1:1 for ads watched or dollarss of Kin bought by users.

## Buy Track Adjustment

Module developers are currently required to prove that:
- The user either watched an advertisement, filled out a survey or paid in another currency for the Kin before Kin was sent to the developer.
- *The user/developer are paid Kin at a rate at most 3x the market rate (i.e. a user can earn the developer at most $0.03 worth of Kin for an ad generating $0.01 of revenue, and a user buying $1.00 worth of kin cannot receive more than $3.00 worth of Kin).*
- Kin was purchased on the open market.

We recommend the second requirement (*italics*) be modified to:
- *The user/developer are paid Kin at a rate at most the market rate for Kin as calculated on the date of purchase (i.e. a user can earn the developer at most $0.01 worth of Kin for an ad generating $0.01 of revenue, and a user buying $1.00 worth of kin cannot receive more than $1.00 worth of Kin).*

## Implementation
We recommend these changes take effect immediately.
