# Kin Improvement Proposal
The purpose of this document is to outline a proposed improvement to the existing KRE algorithm. 

*versioning:*
- *2.2.3*

## Proposed by:
*Kik Interactive Inc*

## Summary of Improvements
The KRE runs on UTC time. We wish to add a note that makes it explicitly clear that the definition of a "day" is based on UTC.

## Implementation
We propose this is included in the KRE as soon as it is approved.
